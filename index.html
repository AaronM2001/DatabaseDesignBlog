            <p>There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>SQL commands are the instructions used to communicate with a database to perform tasks, functions, and queries with data</li>
              <li>Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands that define the different structures in a database</li>
              <li>A data manipulation language is a computer programming language used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database.</li>
              <li>DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system</li>
              <li>TCL stands for Transaction Control Languages. These commands are used for maintaining consistency of the database and for the management of transactions made by the DML commands</li>
              <li>DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.</li>

                <h5>Database normalization is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model.</h5>
